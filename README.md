Modern Art Machine is a creative web application that generates unique and abstract digital art. Inspired by the fascinating world of modern art, this project aims to provide users with an interactive and visually captivating experience.

## Features

- **Randomized Art Generation:** With a single click, the Modern Art Machine creates original and visually striking art pieces.

- **Download and Share:** Once a visually appealing composition is generated, users have the option to download the artwork and share it with friends and on social media platforms.

## How to Use

Open the Modern Art Machine web application by visiting [https://zyabrik10.github.io/modern_art_machine/](https://zyabrik10.github.io/modern_art_machine/).
In order to create a triangle, you need three points.
So, the first three clicks will initialize these three points. 
Consequently, a triangle will be drawn. 
With the next click, the first point will be changed, the second point will become the first point, and the third point will become the second point.
Then, a new triangle will be drawn again.
